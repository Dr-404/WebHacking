#### Method

- The method tells the server what kind of action the client wants


`GET` — used to retrieve or read a resource. If successful, the response will contain the resource specified in the URL. APIs mainly deal in JSOn and XML files. ** GET Request do not have message body **

`POST` — used to create new resources, including subordinate resources to already existing nouns. A successful response will contain the URL of the newly created resource.

`PUT` — used to update an existing resource. The request will also contain the new information that should replace the existing one in the resource.

`PATCH` — like PUT, updates an existing resource, but differently. Instead of sending the new data, it sends instructions on how to modify the current resource.

`DELETE` — used to, as the name suggests, delete a resource.

- `key: value`

#### `Host` Header 
- Specify the host name that appear in full URL	
- This is necessary when multiple websit are hosted on the same server 

#### `Content-Length` Header

- Value is the length of the response body in `bytes`
- It is helpful to hacker to decipher the applicaiton response to input  (escepially brute-force attacks)

#### `Location` Header 

- This Header is used when applicaiton redirect a user to a new page

#### `cookie` Header

- `cookie` - a small piece of data from website or web server that stored within user computer by web browser. 
- They can also be used to save for subsequent use information that the user previously entered into form fields, such as names, addresses, passwords, and payment card numbers.

- This Header send cookie back to the server to maintain user's session

- ** This cookie provide valid session and it can be use in attacks against other application users **
