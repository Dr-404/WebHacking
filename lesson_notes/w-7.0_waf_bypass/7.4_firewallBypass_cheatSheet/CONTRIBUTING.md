## Contribution Guidelines

__Your pull request/commit message will be a tweet, please keep that in mind.__ :)

- **To add to the list:** Submit a pull request.
- **To remove from the list:** Submit a pull request.
- Want to change something: Submit a pull request.
- Want to try something else: Submit a pull request.
- Don't know what to do: Submit a pull request or open an issue, let me know what's going on.

[Awesome-WAF](https://github.com/0xinfection/awesome-waf) is a hand-crafted list for high-quality information about web application firewalls and its resources. Following items are recommended to be kept in mind.

- If you are submitting a new fingerprint, include the headers/page source, etc.
- Do not include the URL as it may expose the integrity of the site.
> I will contact you personally if necessary via email.
- Item you're adding should not be duplicate, no redirection (be careful with `http` vs `https`!).
- The link should be the name of the slide or project or website.
- Description should be clear and concise (read it out loud to be sure).
- Description should follow the link, on the same line.
- if you want to add more than one link, please don't do all PR on the exact same line, it usually results in conflicts and your PR cannot be automatically merged.

Please contribute links to slides/tools you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

## Quality Standard

Note that we can help you achieve those standards, just try your best, be brave.
We'll guide you to the best of our abilities.

To be on the list, it would be *nice* if entries adhere to these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community.
- Clearly stating "what is it for": mention the problem it solves. Just try your best, make it clear for the next person.
- Solves a real problem (even a small one)
- If your PR is a **WIP** (work in progress, not safe for production), mention it.

If your PR is not merged, I will tell you why so that you may be able to improve it.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Adding to this List

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the list is useful before submitting. That implies it has enough content and every item has a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.
- The body of your commit message should contain a link to the repository.

Thank you for your contributions!

### Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
